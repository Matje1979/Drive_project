# Drive_project

Website that mirrors google drive content

The goal of this project is creating a website that can pull the metadata about google drive content
such as files and folders names, links, MimeTypes, etc, and present to the users in the Windows Explorer style.

The code of the project consists of two parts, the scripts that interacts with google drive via google drive api, and Django.
There is also frontend wich should use AJAX to mimic the Windows Explorer.
